# JavaScript Class Syntax Practice: Calculated Properties
> The learning objective for this challenge is to write a getter for the comboPrice property of a pizza restaurant. This lets you explore the concept of calculated properties.

Consider the restaraunt class example from earlier, it uses methods to set some values and calculate others. Refactor the `comboPrice()` method we added to the Restaurant object to utilize getters to make this calculation a method on your class.
